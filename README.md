__Boston Housing Dataset with Support Vector, Decision Tree and Random Forest__

This is the continution of my previous project "Boston Housing Dataset with Linear and Polynomial Regression".

__About Bostonhousing dataset__:

The Boston housing dataset is a famous dataset from the 1970s.
Alongside with price, the dataset also provide information such as Crime (CRIM), areas of non-retail business in the town (INDUS), the age of people who own the house (AGE), and there are many other attributes that are available.

__Aim__:

In total, there are 506 samples and 14 feature variables in this dataset. 
The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features and to minimise the error.

__Available information__:

* data : has all the inputs
* target: has house median values
* bostan_data: has all the details or data of housing dataset
* feature_names: ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT']

__Steps involved__: 

1) Applying Support Vector
2) Applying Decision Tree 
3) Applying Random Forest
